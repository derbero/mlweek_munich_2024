## Abstract
This case study provides a comprehensive examination of the methods investigated by Mercedes-Benz to personalize customer offers through the application of persona clusters. The project, initiated in a pilot market, involved the prediction of customer personas based on data collected from a global survey. The presentation will detail the process of obtaining labeled data for the purpose of training machine learning models, discuss the challenges encountered, and outline the prospective continuation of this initiative. Attendees will gain an understanding of the analytical techniques and strategic planning necessary to enhance customer experience and business outcomes.
